            Bread and sourdough have a long and rich history dating back
            thousands of years. The earliest evidence of bread-making dates back
            to ancient civilizations in Egypt, where it was a staple food. In
            those times, people would mix flour and water to create a simple
            dough, which would then be baked on hot stones.

            Sourdough, on the other hand, has been used for baking bread for
            even longer. It is believed that sourdough was discovered by
            accident when a mixture of flour and water was left to ferment for
            several days, creating a naturally occurring mixture of yeast and
            lactic acid bacteria. This mixture, also known as a sourdough
            starter, can be used to make bread that has a unique flavor and
            texture, as well as longer shelf life, compared to bread made with
            commercial yeast.

            The use of sourdough in bread-making spread from ancient
            civilizations to Europe, where it became a staple food. During the
            colonial era, sourdough was brought to the Americas by settlers, who
            used it to make bread in their new homes. Today, sourdough is still
            used in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe and the
            United States, where it is prized for its unique flavor and texture.

            In recent years, sourdough has experienced a resurgence in
            popularity as more people seek out traditional, unprocessed foods.
            With the rise of artisanal bakeries and an increased interest in
            home baking, sourdough has once again become a staple in many
            kitchens.
