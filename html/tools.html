        <h1>Essential Tools for Sourdough</h1>
        <p>
          If you are new to the world of sourdough bread baking, you might be
          wondering what equipment and tools are needed to bake sourdough bread.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is that you don't need to spend a fortune on kitchen
          supplies in order to bake sourdough bread successfully.

        <h2 id="starter">Sourdough Starter</h2>
        <img
          src="../img/sourdough-starter-risen-in-a-jar.jpg"
          href="sourdough starter"
        />
        <p>
          First things first. In order to make sourdough bread you need a
          sourdough starter. If you don't have one, head over to the
          <a href="starter.html">sourdough starter page</a> and get it going.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also have the choice to
          <a
            href="https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/classic-fresh-sourdough-starter"
            >buy a sourdough starter.
          </a>
          you make your own or buy one, it will take several days until you will
          be able to bake sourdough bread.
        </p>

        <h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>
        <img src="../img/glass-containers.jpg" href="glass containers" />

        <p>
          The sourdough starter can be stored in a variety of different
          containers. They can be made of glass, plastic, or ceramic containers,
          just to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glass containers with straight edges allow you to see the activity of
          the starter after it has been fed. Some of my favorites are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://a.co/d/btVqNDB">mason jars</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://a.co/d/enAXcPu">weck jars</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of these containers comes with a lid that can be used to cover
          the starter while it rests. I like to keep two containers handy. One
          to store the extra starter in the fridge and one to transfer a small
          amount to feed for a recipe.
        </p>

        <h2 id="scale">Baker's scale</h2>
        <img

          alt="starter-maintenance-feeding"
        />
        <p>
          The best method for measuring ingredients for sourdough recipes is to
          weigh them with a
          <a href="https://a.co/d/8JeCDGu">kitchen scale</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because measuring cups and spoons are not accurate enough, most
          sourdough recipes provide measurements for flour and water in grams.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bowl">Batter bowl with lid</h2>
        <img
          src="../img/sourdough-hawaiian-rolls-dough-in-a-bowl.webp"
          alt="sourdough-in-a-bowl"
        />
        <p>
          A <a href="https://a.co/d/866rRfn">batter bowl with a lid</a> is an
          excellent, multi-purpose tool, that can be used for mixing and resting
          the dough. The clear sides have measurements on the sides and it also
          allows you to see how much the dough has risen.
        </p>

        <h2 id="scraper">Bench scraper</h2>
        <img
          src="../img/A-woman-using-a-bench-scraper.jpg"
          alt="A-woman-using-a-bench-scraper"
        />
        <p>
          When making sourdough, having a
          <a href="https://a.co/d/1oAKGVL">bench scraper</a> and/or a
          <a href="https://a.co/d/0WWkCve">bowl scraper</a> is a must.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bench scraper can be used to shape the dough, divide the dough, keep
          it from sticking to the work surface, turn the dough, and much more.
        </p>

        <h2 id="banneton">Banneton or proofing bowl</h2>
        <img
          src="../img/einkorn-sourdough-in-banneton.jpg"
          alt="einkorn-sourdough-in-banneton"
        />
        <p>
          A <a href="https://a.co/d/gA0rewP">banneton</a> is a proofing bowl
          made from organic materials and is anywhere from 8-10" in diameter at
          the opening. After the dough has had its final shape, it is placed in
          a proofing bowl for the second rise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proofing bowl provides structure to the sides of the dough as it
          rises so that it keeps its shape when it bakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bowl can be lined with a kitchen towel or floured to prevent the
          dough from sticking as it rises. Any similar size bowl can be used as
          a proofing bowl.
        </p>

        <h2 id="covers">Bowl covers</h2>
        <p>
          Silicone <a href="https://a.co/d/47j3Yh1">bowl covers</a> are best for
          keeping dough covered not only because they can be used over and over
          again, but they keep the dough from drying out on the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plastic wrap, plastic shower caps, a damp flour sack towel, or even a
          plate can also be used to cover a bowl of dough.
        </p>

        <h2 id="lame">Bread lame</h2>
        <p>
          A <a href="https://a.co/d/5fZDTov">bread lame</a> is a stick-shaped
          tool that holds a razor on one end that is used to score or slash the
          dough before it bakes. A very sharp knife can also be used to score
          the dough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because dough will expand at its weakest point as it bakes, it is
          slashed to control the spot of the expansion.
        </p>

        <h2 id="oven">Dutch Oven</h2>
        <img
          src="../img/beginner-sourdough-bread-recipe-1.jpg"
          href="dutch-oven"
        />
        <p>
          A <a href="https://a.co/d/8Am3rGT">dutch oven</a> with a lid is used
          to bake sourdough bread because it mimics a commercial steam oven.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the first several minutes of baking, steam is released from the
          dough and trapped inside the dutch oven which gives the dough a better
          oven spring.
        </p>

        <h2 id="gloves">Long silicone gloves</h2>
        <p>
          Sourdough baking requires very hot oven temperatures. Invest in a set
          of <a href="https://a.co/d/dksb5oP">long silicone gloves</a> to
          protect not only your hands but your forearms as well.
        </p>

        <h2 id="paper">Parchment paper</h2>
        <img
          src="../img/einkorn-sourdough-fresh-out-of-the-oven.jpg"
          href="sourdough-fresh"
        />
        <p>
          Parchment paper makes it easy to transfer the dough to and from the
          dutch oven. It also keeps the dough from sticking to the bottom of the
          baking vessel.
        </p>

        <h2 id="rack">Cooling rack</h2>
        <p>
          A <a href="https://a.co/d/cMSt7ap">cooling rack</a> allows air to
          circulate around the loaf of bread as it cools.
        </p>

        <h2 id="knife">Bread Knife</h2>
        <p>
          The crust of sourdough is thick and can be hard to cut. Invest in a
          <a href="https://a.co/d/aQrZadU">bread knife</a> or use an electric
          knife to cut sourdough bread.
