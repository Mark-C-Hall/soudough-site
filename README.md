# Sour-do's-and-dont's

## Description

A static site for my IFT 301 Web Design Class, showcasing my basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills in a lightweight manner. Please note that this project is not a testament to my UI design skills, as they are as non-existent as a sourdough starter without flour.

## About

This site is an informational hub about the art and science of making and baking sourdough. It features pages on the history of sourdough, the science behind it, the essential equipment, the process of creating a starter, baking techniques, and any additional info that will help you on your sourdough journey.

## Project Requirements

The web design project will be a demonstration of your cumulative skill in this course. You will create a website about a favorite hobby or subject, your family, a church or club you belong to, a company that a friend owns, the company you work for, or any other approved topic. Your website must contain a home page and at least six (but no more than eight) content pages. This web design project will have deliverables due throughout the course and the final product will be turned in on the last day of class.
