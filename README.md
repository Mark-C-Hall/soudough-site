# Sour-do's-and-dont's

## Description
A static site for my IFT 301 Web Design Class.

## About
This site will be an informational site about making and baking sourdough. There will be pages on 
the history of sourdough, the science behind it, the equipment you'll need, how to make a 
starter, how to bake, and any additional info.

## Project Description
The web design project will be a demonstration of your cumulative skill in this course. You will 
create a website about a favorite hobby or subject, your family, a church or club you belong to, 
a company that a friend owns, the company you work for, or any other approved topic. Your website 
must contain a home page and at least six (but no more than eight) content pages. This web design 
project will have deliverables due throughout the course and the final product will be turned in 
on the last day of class.
