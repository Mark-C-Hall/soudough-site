        <h1>Rustic Sourdough Bread recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>225g ripe and fed sourdough starter</li>
          <li>810g of Bread Flour</li>
          <li>90g of Whole Wheat Flour</li>
          <li>600g Lukewarm water</li>
          <li>18g Kosher Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large bowl combine all of the whole wheat flour, 710g of the
            bread flour, and 500g of lukewarm water. Mix until well-combined and
            no dry flour spots remain. This is called the autolyse and helps
            with gluten strength. Let rest covered for 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            To the bowl add the discard of your sourdough starter, about 225g.
            Add the remaining bread flour (100g), and water (100g), and salt.
            Mix well until well-combined and let rest covered for 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            To help with gluten formation, lift the dough up by the edge and
            fold over itself. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and complete for each
            of the 4 edges of the dough. Let rest for 30 minutes covered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat step 3 three additional times. Once completed, let rest for 4
            hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove dough from bowl and split into two equal masses. Shape the
            dough into rounds and place into bannetons. Cover the bannetons and
            let rest overnight in the fridge.
          </li>
          <li>
            The next day, begin preheating oven with dutch oven in main oven for
            one hour at 425&#8457;
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove one of the loafs from the fridge and place on parchment
            paper. Using a sharp knife or bread lame, cut a long line over the
            top, or any other pattern you wish. Carefully remove the hot dutch
            oven and place the loaf in. Optionally spray the loaf with water to
            help with oven rise. Cover and let bake for 25 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the lid of the dutch oven and drop the heat to 350&#8457;. Bake
            for around 20 minutes or until a nice brown crust is formed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove loaf from oven and move over to baking rack. Let cool for
            over an hour to help preserve the loaf. Meanwhile, repeat steps 7 &
            8 for second loaf.
