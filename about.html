      <h1>The Science of Sourdough</h1>

        <p>
          Sourdough bread is made using a fermented mixture of flour and water,
          known as a sourdough starter. This starter contains wild yeasts and
          beneficial bacteria that ferment the sugars in the flour, creating the
          characteristic tangy taste and airy texture of sourdough bread. The
          fermentation process also makes sourdough bread more nutritious and
          easier to digest than bread made with commercial yeast.

      <h2>How Sourdough is Made</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Making sourdough bread involves a few basic steps: creating and
          maintaining a sourdough starter, mixing the dough, and allowing it to
          rise through fermentation. To create a starter, flour and water are
          mixed together and left to sit for several days until wild yeasts and
          bacteria naturally present in the flour begin to ferment it. Once the
          starter is active, it can be used to leaven bread. To make the dough,
          flour and water are mixed with the starter, then left to rise for
          several hours before being shaped and baked. The fermentation process
          can take anywhere from several hours to a full day, depending on
          factors such as temperature and the strength of the starter.

      <h2>Why Sourdough is Special</h2>
      <div>

        <p>
          Sourdough bread has been made for thousands of years and holds a
          special place in many cultures. It is valued for its unique taste,
          texture, and the fact that it does not require commercial yeast.
          Additionally, some people find it easier to digest than bread made
          with commercial yeast. Sourdough bread is also considered a healthier
          option as the fermentation process increases nutrient availability,
          and also reduces phytates and gluten content. With the rise of
          gluten-free diets and interest in traditional food preparation
          methods, sourdough has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent
          years.
